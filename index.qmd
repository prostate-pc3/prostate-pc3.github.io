The Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (PC3) is a working group within the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cohort Consortium. 

## Mission

The **mission** of PC3 is to bring together intramural and extramural researchers and resources to address outstanding research questions in prostate cancer etiology, prevention, and survivorship. 

## Goals

1. **To provide a forum for researchers** with expertise and/or interest in prostate cancer to form large-scale collaborations and coalesce around ideas and methodologic approaches.
2. **To create shared data and biospecimen resources** for pooled studies of prostate cancer, with an emphasis on rarer prostate cancer outcomes (*i.e.*, clinical and molecular disease subtypes) that are difficult to study in a single cohort.
3. **To fill knowledge gaps** in prostate cancer epidemiology, including but not limited to: 
    + Etiology of clinical and molecular disease subtypes
    + Survival and survivorship among men with a prostate cancer diagnosis
    + Reasons and mitigation strategies for racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality
