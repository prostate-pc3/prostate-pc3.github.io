### This year's annual PC3 meeting: Save the date (May 2024)

The Annual Meeting of PC3 will be held as part of the NCI Cohort Consortium meeting on **Thursday, November 14, 2024 at 1:00-2:00 pm ET**. The meeting will be in person at the NCI campus in Rockville, MD, with a virtual dial-in option. Registration is through the [NCI Cohort Consortium](https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/cohort-consortium/). Please reach out to PC3 leadership with any updates or suggestions for the agenda.


### Impact of the PC3 definition of aggressive prostate cancer (April 2024)

The PC3 consensus definition of aggressive prostate cancer (also see [News from February 2023](https://prostate-pc3.github.io/news.html#pc3-definition-of-aggressive-prostate-cancer-validated-february-2023)) has seen rapid uptake in etiologic epidemiology studies. Several dozen studies have employed this definition. As intended, while many studies have used a different primary outcome definition, they provide results for the [PC3 definition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33010161/) of stage T4 or N1 or M1 or Gleason score of 8 or greater prostate cancer in supplementary results to facilitate a comparison of results across studies.

The annual meeting brought together in-person attendees at the NCI in Rockville, MD, plus dozens of investigators attending virtually to share updates about recent developments in PC3 and and grant strategies. [Ruth Travis](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/ruth-travis) presented updates on proteins, metabolites, and prostate cancer risk. The attendees also discussed how PC3 can successfully further facilitate collaboration.

### PC3 definition of aggressive prostate cancer validated (February 2023)

In the era of widespread prostate-specific antigen testing, it is important to focus etiologic research on the outcome of aggressive prostate cancer, but studies have defined this outcome differently. PC3 developed an evidence-based consensus definition of aggressive prostate cancer using clinical features at diagnosis for etiologic epidemiologic research ([Hurwitz *et al.* J Natl Cancer Inst 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33010161/)). This definition has now been validated by PC3 members in the population-based Janus Serum Bank cohort, linked to the population-based Cancer Registry of Norway ([Robsahm *et al.* Acta Oncol 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36762472/)).
