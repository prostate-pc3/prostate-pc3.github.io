### PC3 definition of aggressive prostate cancer validated (February 2023)

In the era of widespread prostate-specific antigen testing, it is important to focus etiologic research on the outcome of aggressive prostate cancer, but studies have defined this outcome differently. PC3 developed an evidence-based consensus definition of aggressive prostate cancer using clinical features at diagnosis for etiologic epidemiologic research ([Hurwitz *et al.* J Natl Cancer Inst 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33010161/)). This definition has now been validated by PC3 members in the population-based Janus Serum Bank cohort, linked to the population-based Cancer Registry of Norway ([Robsahm *et al.* Acta Oncol 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36762472/)).
